# Running the game

It is recommended that you run this game with Java 8. You can check your java version using:
```
java -version
```
The game uses OpenGl 3.20, and should be supported by every operating system.

## Running the jar file
The game is a jar executable, which you can run from the command line using:
```
java -jar FILE_NAME
```
Or you can most likely double click the file and it will run on it’s own.

## Issues
If you have issues running the game try the following:
* Make sure that you are running the newest version
* Update your graphics drivers
* Check your Java version

If none of that works for you, then please open an issue with your problem here on Github. Run the game using the command line, and paste the error in the issue description. Don’t forget to add your operating system.
